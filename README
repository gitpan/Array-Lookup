Array::Lookup is a Perl 5 module which performs a search through an
array of strings, allowing for abbreviation of the search key. 

The Lookup subroutine is especially handy for doing keyword lookups in
an array or hash table, where the keyword may be abbreviated.  Exact
matches are give priority over abbreviated matches. 

The module has embedded POD text with which man or HTML pages can be
created.

For detailed usage information, you can do:

    pod2man Sys::Lookup.pm | nroff -man 

The module is accompanied with a Perl Makefile.PL, this README, a 
test program (test.pl), a reference test output file, and the GNU 
License, under which this software is freely available.

The archives are available at the usual CPAN sites.  The California 
CPAN site is:

    California       ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/perl/CPAN/

Contributions or improvements are welcome.
